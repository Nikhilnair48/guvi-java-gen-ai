# Lecture 35 - Graphs: Adjacency List, DFS, BFS, Weighted Graph Intro
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Represent graphs using adjacency lists and traverse using DFS and BFS.

## Materials
- Live coding: [live-coding/lecture-35/lecture-35](./live-coding/lecture-35/lecture-35/)

## What we covered
- Graph representation using adjacency list
- Directed vs undirected graphs (controlled by a flag)
- addEdge and neighbors APIs
- DFS traversal using recursion (visited array)
- BFS traversal using a queue (visited array)
- Weighted graph representation using Edge objects (to, weight)

## Live coding
