# Lecture 3 - Loops and Intro to Functions
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Use loops to repeat work safely, and practice basic method writing from the problem set.

## Materials
- Slides (used for Lectures 2 and 3): [SDE_w__AI_Lecture_2_&_3.pdf](./lecture/SDE_w__AI_Lecture_2_%26_3.pdf)
- Live coding: [lecture-3](./live-coding/lecture-3/)
- Problem set (Lectures 2 and 3): [lecture-2-3-problem-set.md](./exercises/lecture-2-3-problem-set.md)
- Solutions: [lecture-2-3-problem-solutions.md](./exercises/lecture-2-3-problem-solutions.md)

## What we covered
- for, while, do-while loops
- break and continue
- Off-by-one awareness (loop boundaries)
- Basic methods (signatures, params, return values, overloading) via problem set

## Live coding
Location: [live-coding/lecture-3](./live-coding/lecture-3/)  
Start here: [Main.java](./live-coding/lecture-3/Main.java)

What to notice
- Loops and operators shown as small runnable snippets
- Refactored loop demos:
  - [ForLoops.java](./live-coding/lecture-3/com/guvi/refactored/ForLoops.java)
  - [WhileLoops.java](./live-coding/lecture-3/com/guvi/refactored/WhileLoops.java)
  - [DoWhileLoop.java](./live-coding/lecture-3/com/guvi/refactored/DoWhileLoop.java)
