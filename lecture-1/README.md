# Lecture 1 - Java Setup and Hello World
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Set up Java and IntelliJ, then run your first Java program.

## Materials
- Slides: [SDE_w_ AI_ Lecture 1.pdf](./lecture/SDE_w_%20AI_%20Lecture%201.pdf)
- Setup guide: [lecture-01-setup.md](./lecture/lecture-01-setup.md)
- Live coding project: [hello-world](./live-coding/hello-world/)
- Problem set: [lecture-1-problem-set.md](./exercises/lecture-1-problem-set.md)
- Solutions: [lecture-1-problem-set-solutions.md](./exercises/lecture-1-problem-set-solutions.md)

## What we covered
- JDK, JVM, JRE (what each one is)
- Installing Java and configuring IntelliJ
- The `main` method and basic console output with `System.out.println`

## Live coding
Location: [live-coding/hello-world](./live-coding/hello-world/)  
Start here: [Main.java](./live-coding/hello-world/src/Main.java)

What to notice
- `public static void main(String[] args)` as the program entry point
- A minimal program that prints output to the console
