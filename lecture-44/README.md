# Lecture 44 - LeetCode Practice Session 2 (Isomorphic Strings)
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Deepen understanding of one-to-one mappings using HashMaps.

## Materials
- Discussion notes: [leetcode-discussion.md](./live-coding/leetcode-discussion.md)

## What we covered
- Isomorphic Strings examples and failure cases
- Two HashMap approach to enforce mapping in both directions
- Consistency checks while iterating through both strings

## Live coding
Location: [live-coding](./live-coding/)
