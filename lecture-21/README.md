# Lecture 21 - DSA Practice: Pointers, Sliding Window, Backtracking, Memoization
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Practice core DSA patterns across a few classic problems.

## Materials
- Live coding: [live-coding/lecture-21](./live-coding/lecture-21/)

## What we covered
- Two pointers for in-place array rearrangement (move all zeros to the end)
- One-pass scan for max profit (best time to buy and sell stock)
- Memoization to speed up recursion (count ways to climb steps)
- Backtracking to generate subsequences with constraints (sum <= K)
