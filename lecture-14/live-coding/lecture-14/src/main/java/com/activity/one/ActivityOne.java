/*
Context: you are designing a simple developer profile card for an internal dashboard.
 The goal is to make the code cleaner and more expressive using modern Java features
Tasks
 - Replace the Developer class with a record that models name, id, and note.
 - Store the developerâ€™s note as a text block with two lines: greeting and reminder.
 - Use var wherever the initializer makes the type obvious.
 - Redesign Badge as a sealed interface with exactly two permitted types: GoldBadge and SilverBadge.
 - Identify one feature that improves readability but could limit flexibility, and explain why.
