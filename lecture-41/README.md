# Lecture 41 - MongoDB Basics (BSON Types, Queries) and SQL Joins Recap
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Understand MongoDB BSON data types and core query/update patterns. Also connect the SQL idea of joins and foreign keys.

## Materials
- Slides: [Lecture 41 - MongoDb.pdf](./lecture/Lecture%2041%20-%20MongoDb.pdf)
- MongoDB notes and examples: [MongoDB-Types-Queries.md](./live-coding/MongoDB-Types-Queries.md)
- SQL joins and foreign keys recap: [MySQL-join-FK.md](./live-coding/MySQL-join-FK.md)
- SQL script (students_v2 + queries): [students_v2_aggregate.sql](./live-coding/students_v2_aggregate.sql)

## What we covered
- MongoDB stores documents as BSON (JSON-like, but optimized for storage/querying)
- Common BSON types and where they show up in documents
- find basics and common filters
- updateOne patterns and update operators (examples in notes)
- SQL recap: foreign keys and joins as the relational way to connect tables
