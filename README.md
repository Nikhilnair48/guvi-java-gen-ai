# SDE with AI: Java Module

This repository contains the Java module from the broader SDE with AI program.  
It is designed for learners who want to build a solid foundation in programming through hands-on reasoning and progressive problem-solving.  
Each lecture introduces one or two key ideas and builds on what was covered earlier, supported by live coding, notes, and exercises.

## Course Overview

The course moves from programming fundamentals to advanced Java concepts.  
It focuses on writing clear, correct, and maintainable code.  
Each lecture connects a problem to its solution; the learner explores why the problem exists, what approaches can solve it, and how Java’s language features fit that reasoning.

Each lecture includes:

* Notes that explain the underlying idea and how it fits into the bigger picture.
* Live coding examples that demonstrate those ideas in action.
* Exercises that help the learner practice and internalize the concepts.

## Repository Overview

The repository is organized into folders named `lecture-1` through `lecture-14`.

Each folder contains:

* `lecture/`: Concept notes and slides
* `live-coding/`: Code written during live sessions
* `exercises/`: Practice problems and solutions

All lectures align with the official course curriculum. Some topics span multiple sessions, and others combine due to pacing or doubt sessions.

## Learning Experience

Each lecture connects a conceptual idea to its implementation. The process follows a steady rhythm:

1. Introduce a problem that mirrors something real.  
2. Explore how Java provides tools to address that problem.  
3. Build a working example, test it, and refine it.  
4. Reflect briefly on why this approach works better than alternatives.

| Component     | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lecture Notes | Explain the concept and its role in the larger system.       |
| Live Coding   | Demonstrate the step-by-step reasoning through code.         |
| Exercises     | Strengthen understanding by applying concepts independently. |

The goal is not to rush through content but to make learners comfortable reading, reasoning about, and improving code.
