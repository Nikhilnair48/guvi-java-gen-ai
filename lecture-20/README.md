# Lecture 20 - Recursion and Backtracking (Subsequences)
Roadmap Day: TBD

Goal: Generate subsequences using backtracking and solve a classic count-ways recursion.

## Materials
- Live coding: [lecture-20](./live-coding/lecture-20/)
- Problem set: [lecture-20-problem-set.md](./exercises/lecture-20-problem-set.md)

## What we covered
- Backtracking idea: choose and not-choose decisions
- Generating all subsequences of a string
- Counting ways to reach step n with 1-step or 2-step jumps
